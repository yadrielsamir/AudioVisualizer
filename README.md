# openFrameworks Audio Visualizer
The objective for this first project is to complete this audiovisualizer with the help of openFrameworks!

## ofApp
This is the class that brings most things together. Here, you will find the code that causes the audio to play and pause. It is also to where the visualization happens. Here, you can observe how the code to change between modes works, and how the song is actually played. 

## AudioVisualizer
The AudioVisualizer class provides us with the data needed to do the visualization. Using some of the tools OpenFrameworks provides us and math, we can obtain information such as the amplitude of the sound.
